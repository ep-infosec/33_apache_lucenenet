# Wiki

---

There's a lot of scattered (_but important!_) information on the **[Lucene.Net wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/LUCENENET/Lucene.Net)**. Quite a few of the links on this website currently link to the wiki but the plan is to migrate all of the relevant & important docs over to this website.

If that's something you think you might want to help out with, see the [Contributing section](xref:contributing) for more info.
