Analysis for indexing phonetic signatures (for sounds-alike search)

For an introduction to Lucene's analysis API, see the [Lucene.Net.Analysis](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.html) namespace documentation. 

This module provides analysis components (using encoders ported to .NET from [Apache Commons Codec](http://commons.apache.org/codec/)) that index and search phonetic signatures.
