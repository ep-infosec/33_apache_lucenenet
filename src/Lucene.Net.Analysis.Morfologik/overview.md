This package provides dictionary-driven lemmatization ("accurate stemming") filter and analyzer for the Polish Language, driven by the [Morfologik library](http://morfologik.blogspot.com/) developed by Dawid Weiss and Marcin Mi≈Çkowski. 

For an introduction to Lucene's analysis API, see the [Lucene.Net.Analysis](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.html) namespace documentation. 

The MorfologikFilter yields one or more terms for each token. Each of those terms is given the same position in the index.
