# Javascript expressions

A Javascript expression is a numeric expression specified using an expression syntax that's based on JavaScript expressions. You can construct expressions using:

*   Integer, floating point, hex and octal literals

*   Arithmetic operators: `+ - * / %`

*   Bitwise operators: `| & ^ ~ << >> >>>`

*   Boolean operators (including the ternary operator): `&& || ! ?:`

*   Comparison operators: `&lt; <= == >= >`

*   Common mathematic functions: `abs ceil exp floor ln log2 log10 logn max min sqrt pow`

*   Trigonometric library functions: `acosh acos asinh asin atanh atan atan2 cosh cos sinh sin tanh tan`

*   Distance functions: `haversin`

*   Miscellaneous functions: `min, max`

*   Arbitrary external variables - see <xref:Lucene.Net.Expressions.Bindings>

 JavaScript order of precedence rules apply for operators. Shortcut evaluation is used for logical operatorsâ€”the second argument is only evaluated if the value of the expression cannot be determined after evaluating the first argument. For example, in the expression `a || b`, `b` is only evaluated if a is not true.
